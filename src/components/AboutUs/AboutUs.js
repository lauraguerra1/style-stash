          <p className='info-text'>Hello! I'm a Denver-based software engineer with a unique journey  that blends culture, entrepreneurship, and technology. As the daughter of a first-generation immigrant from Thailand, I've embraced diverse perspectives since childhood. After earning a degree in Psychology and Japanese Studies from the University of Colorado, Boulder, I co-owned a thriving restaurant for a decade, honing skills in management, communication, and creative problem-solving. My next chapter is focused on transitioning into software development, driven by my passion for problem-solving and technology.<br /><br />
          With a foundation in entrepreneurship, I bring leadership, adaptability, and a unique cultural perspective to the table. I'm on the lookout for a role that marries my skills and experiences, ideally contributing to a company dedicated to enhancing user experiences by bridging cultures. </p>

          As an immigrant from Brazil, my journey has been defined by a commitment to empowering individuals with disadvantaged backgrounds. Over the past five years, I have dedicated myself to the mental health treatment field, witnessing the transformative power of support and opportunities for those in need. <br /><br />
          During this time, I also discovered my love for innovative problem-solving and a thirst for continuous learning. It was through this pursuit that I stumbled upon a new path in Software Engineeringâ€”a field that offered me the chance to create valuable changes through product design and customer interfaces.<br /><br />
          Taking a leap of faith, I joined Turing's program to equip myself with the skills to make a difference in a different way. For me, giving back means working in a role where I can create a tangible impact, and I firmly believe that software development provides numerous opportunities to achieve that goal.
